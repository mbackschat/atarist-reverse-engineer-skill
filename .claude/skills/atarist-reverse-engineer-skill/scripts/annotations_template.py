"""
Annotation Database Template for Atari ST Binary Disassembly

Copy this file to your tools/ directory as annotations.py, then populate
the dictionaries with comments discovered during code analysis.

BLOCK_COMMENTS: Multi-line comments inserted BEFORE the instruction at the offset.
                Used for subroutine headers, algorithm descriptions, section intros.
                EVERY subroutine must have a block comment — be detailed about the
                algorithm, data structures, arguments, and return values.

INLINE_COMMENTS: Single-line comments appended to the instruction at the offset.
                 Used for per-instruction explanations.
                 CRITICAL: Maintain >=60% comment density from start to finish.
                 Do NOT let density drop off after the first few hundred lines.
                 Every section of the binary must be annotated to the same standard.

DATA_REGIONS:   Regions that contain data (not code) — fonts, string tables, bitmaps,
                lookup tables. These will be rendered as hex dumps instead of
                disassembled instructions.
                CONSERVATIVE: Only add regions you are certain are data. It is far
                worse to mark code as data than to leave data as code.

All dictionaries are keyed by CODE OFFSET (not file offset).
Code offset = file offset - 28 (the 28-byte Atari ST header).
