# Section Analysis Prompt Templates

Use these templates when launching **general-purpose agents** to analyze specific code sections. Replace `{SOURCE}` with the path to the SOURCE.txt file, `{LINES}` with the line range, and `{SECTION}` with the section name (e.g., `entry`, `io_wrappers`, `main_loop`).

**IMPORTANT — every agent MUST:**
1. Collect all base-register offsets accessed (e.g., "$663C(A5) = long, current address") — for the Global Variable Map
2. Collect all structure field accesses (e.g., "$0A6C(A3) = word, insert mode flag") — for State Structure Maps
3. Collect all scancodes, command codes, or dispatch values with handler addresses — for dispatch tables
4. Decode all magic numbers (ASCII codes, flag bits, hardware registers, TOS constants)
5. Write step-by-step algorithm descriptions for any non-trivial logic (not just "this routine parses input")
6. **Write ALL annotation findings to a Python fragment file** at `tools/annot_frag_{SECTION}.py` — see output format below

**Explain for non-experts**: Where a code pattern depends on Atari ST or 68000-specific knowledge, include a brief explanation. Common things to explain:
- Basepage fields: +$08=text_start, +$0C=text_size, +$10=data_start, +$14=data_size, +$18=bss_start, +$1C=bss_size
- DTA fields: +$15=attributes, +$1A=file_size(long), +$1E=filename(14 bytes)
- Hardware registers: $FF8240-$FF825E=palette, $FF8260=resolution, $FFFC00=keyboard ACIA
- PEA packed params: e.g., PEA $000BFFFF pushes BIOS func $0B (Kbshift) + param $FFFF as one longword
- SWAP for 32-bit math: 68000 MULU is 16x16 only, so 32-bit multiply requires split operations
- Line-A mouse bracketing: must hide mouse before writing screen RAM to avoid artifacts

## Output Format: Annotation Fragment File

Every agent MUST write its findings to `tools/annot_frag_{SECTION}.py` containing Python dicts. Use only the dicts that have entries:

```python
# Fragment: {SECTION} (offsets $XXXX-$YYYY)

BLOCK_COMMENTS = {
    0x01234: """; -------------------------------------------------------
; routine_name - Brief description
; Algorithm explanation...
;
; Entry: A0 = input, D0 = character
; Exit:  D1 = result
; Trashes: D2, D3
; -------------------------------------------------------""",
}

INLINE_COMMENTS = {
    0x01234: "comment text here",
    0x01238: "Convert lowercase to uppercase (ASCII distance = $20)",
}

KNOWN_SUBS = {
    0x01234: "routine_name",
}

SECTIONS = [
    (0x01234, "Section Name\nDescription line"),
]

DATA_REGIONS = [
    (0x05000, 0x05800, "Font bitmap data"),
]
```

**Rules:**
- All keys are **code offsets** (hex integers like `0x01234`)
- Aim for **>=60% inline comment density** within your section
- Every subroutine MUST have both a BLOCK_COMMENTS entry and a KNOWN_SUBS entry
- After writing the fragment file, return a **markdown summary** of your analysis findings (architecture, algorithms, data structures, variable map entries) for use in ANALYSIS.md
